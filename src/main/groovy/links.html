        Relations to Other Social Problems
    </b>
</h2>

<p>
    During the last century, humans have played a large role in destroying our ecosystem. An equation was formulated by
    Paul and Anne Ehrlich that determines the effect of
    humans on their ecosystem. It reads as follows:
</p>

<div>
    <center>Impact = Population * Affluence * Technology</center>
</div>

<h3>Overpopulation</h3>

<img src="download.jpeg" style="float: right; width: 320px; height: 320px; margin-left: 30px"/>
<p>
    Every other social factor that creates pollution revolves around population. More people living in the world results
    in more people needing resources to live, resulting in
    the faster depletion of resources in our environment. Right now, it is getting to the point of where the human race
    is taking resources so fast that the environment
    cannot renew them as fast as we take. This has a lot to do with "carrying capacity". Carrying capacity is the amount
    of population a species can have before the
    ecosystem cannot support it any longer. As the book <u>Introduction to Social Problems </u> by Thomas J. Sullivan
    says, "The carrying capacity can be exceeded for
    a brief period of time for the environment to regenerate itself. However, exceeding the carrying capacity for a
    long-term basis may do sufficient damage to threaten the
    capacity of the ecosystem to support human life." Most people think, "Humans will never exceed carrying capacity."
    This is not true. During the 2008 financial meltdown,
    it is said that we actually overshot the carrying capacity of the human race for a short while. More information
    about it is <a
        href="http://sunhomedesign.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/human-carrying-capacity-and-the-2008-financial-meltdown/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    A very good example of how population affects the environment was given by Larry Murray during his class. He gives
    the example of a large concert. He talked about how durng the
    concert, a person throws a cup on the ground saying, "It's just one cup." This is true, however, at the concert,
    there are many people that think like that. By the end of the
    concert, trash covers the ground. Also, if you've ever been to a sporting event, you can see it there too. I felt
    that this was a good example of how population affects the
    environment because if only that one person was there, there would only by one piece of trash on the ground.
    However, since there was a large group of people, there was a
    greater magnitude of trash.

<h3>Greedy Affluence</h3>

<img src="download(2).jpeg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 300px; margin-left: 30px"/>
<p>
    Affluence is defined as "a plentiful supply of material goods; wealth." To achieve affluence in today's society,
    many of the Earth's resources have to be depleted for the
    materials needed to create the products that people want. Products include: cars, homes, economic success, etc. If
    only a few of these products were made, the effect on
    the environment would not exist. However, since there are so many people in today's society that want to have the
    biggest and the best, the fantasy above cannot be achieved.
    Every product that is made has to undergo the following processes that hurt the environment: using resources to
    create and use the product, the release of by-products from use,
    and the pollution of the environment when we finally discard the product. Again, this wouldn't be terrible if there
    was only a few products; however, there is a devastating amount
    of products being created everyday.
</p>
<p>
    Our current affluence isn't as big of a problem as the affluence that we are going to face in a few years.
    Less-developed nations like China and India envy superpower nations like the United
    States and Japan. As a result, they want the affluence that the supernations have. As Thomas J. Sullivan says, "it
    is disturbing to consider the two most populous nations on Earth,
    China and India, with a combined population of 2 billion people, to achieve the same level of affluence as the
    United States." This is true. If two billion people obtain the
    products that 310 million Americans have (that are already creating a environemtal problem!) the environment will
    become a catastrophe. Nonetheless, the situation is unavoidable.
    People want the best for themselves along with the best for their children, thus affluence will never be not sought
    after.

<h3>
    Technology
</h3>

<img src="download(3).jpeg" style="float: right; width: 350px; height: 350px; margin-left: 30px"/>
<p>
    When creating new technology, a lot of research has to be poured into the invention to get it properly working.
    Research obviously requires resources, which depletes them from
    the environment. Not only that, waste is produced from the products that are made. Cars, airplanes, and coal trains
    are a good example of this. Also, according to our affluent
    lifestyle, many of these products are going to be made, which is obviously a large impact on the environment.
    Another technology that hurts the environment is electric energy.
    Most people turn on their lights and charge their phone and think nothing of it. Electricity has just always been
    there for them and has become a second nature. Electricity
    is a great invention, however, the amount of resources used and pollution emitted is outstanding. Fossil fuels have
    to be dug out of the ground, which destroys the Earth.
    The fuels then have to be burned, which requires a lot of energy. Finally, the gases produced from the burning
    result in air pollution. Obviously, technology hurts the environment.
</p>

<p>
    While technological advancement creates a negative impact, it also creates a positive impact. Technology can be used
    to reduce pollution also.
    Air pollution is no where near as bad as it was 20 years ago because of all our technological achievements like wind
    and solar power and sulfate/nitrate scrubbers. Technology
    produces a supplement of food and medicine and helps us live a comfortable, more healthy lifestyle. Gasoline used
    today is much less dangerous than gasolene that was used in the past.
    So while technology can be considered a bad thing because of the amount it pollutes, it can also be considered a
    good thing because of how much it unpollutes. As Thomas
    J. Sullivan says, "The problem is not technology by itself, but rather uncontrolled technology that is harnessed the
    gain the greatest short term reward without consideration
    of its impact on the environment.
</p>

<h3>
    Economic Growth
</h3>

<p>
    Economic growth is a key part for any nation's economy. The more products they export, the more money that the
    nation's corporations are going to make. This is important
    for the gross domestic product for the nation and determines how much the nation wants to tax businesses,
    determining how much money the government is going to receive.
    If a nation's population is growing, then more goods need to be produced. Also, peoples' affluence makes businesses
    produce more goods. This doesn't only require more resources
    being used, but also, the disposal of waste is a big factor. Businesses try to find the cheapest way of disposing
    their waste. Examples of this include factories pouring carbon dioxide
    into the air and dumping toxins into a lake or river. Large economic growth is very harmful to the environment, but
    with population increasing, businesses don't have a choice.
